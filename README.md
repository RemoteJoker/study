C/C++,java,python.......

I'm a development engineer who dreams of becoming an architect, so I've distilled what I've learned into notes that I hope can help you tooã€‚

My notes contain C++, python, Java related content and my understanding of the code, if there are any mistakes, please point out

In my other warehouses, there are a few free gadgets I have written that I will do my best to keep available
